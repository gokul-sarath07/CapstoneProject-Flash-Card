## Description
- For those who want to learn spanish, this will help you. The words used for the flash card are from the most frequently used spanish words based on subtitles.
- When starting the program it reads data from the "spanish_to_english.csv" file.
- This "spanish_to_english.csv" file contains spanish and its english word seperated by a comma.
- You are given 3 seconds to remember the english word of the current spanish word. After that it shows you the english word.
- The "YES" button indicates that you remember the translation of the current word.
- The "NO" button indicates that you don't remember the translation of the current word.
- When clicked on the "YES" button it removes the current word and creates a "words_to_learn.csv" file.
- From now on it only reads from the "words_to_learn.csv" file.
- As you click "YES" button, it updates the "words_to_learn.csv" file, so that the words you know won't be shown again.
- When clicked on the "NO" button it randomly choose another word.
